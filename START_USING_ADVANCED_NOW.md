User: "I was flying over water"
Advanced AI:
  - Recognizes FLYING symbol (freedom, perspective)

  - Analyzes emotions (peaceful flying = positive)
  - Extracts elements (action: flying, setting: water)
  - Searches database for related dreams
  - Generates comprehensive analysis
  - Provides 4 reflection questions
